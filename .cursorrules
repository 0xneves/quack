# Quack Development Rules

## Code Style
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow functional programming patterns where possible
- Use descriptive variable names
- Add comments for complex cryptographic operations

## Security
- Never log sensitive data (passwords, keys, plaintexts)
- Clear sensitive data from memory after use
- Always validate user input
- Use constant-time comparison for sensitive strings

## Testing
- Test encryption/decryption with various message lengths
- Test across different websites (YouTube, Twitter, Reddit)
- Verify performance with many encrypted messages
- Test auto-lock functionality

## Git Commits
- Use conventional commits format
- Examples:
  - feat: add secure compose mode
  - fix: resolve decryption blacklist bug
  - docs: update README with installation steps
